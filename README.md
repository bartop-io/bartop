## UI
### UI Development
*These instructions assume you're in the `/bartop-ui` directory*
#### Running the UI
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. The UI depends on the `.env` file located in `bartop-ui/.env`. Use the `bartop-ui/.env.example` file to structure your `.env`. Create an [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) tenant and add the appropriate permissions, and then add the corresponding `.env.` variables. We're working on an isolated dev environment so there isn't so much overhead to contribute, please check back soon :)
3. Run the BarTop UI with `npm start`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the BarTop UI
5. ** BarTop is using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as the starter for our UI. If you run into problems, please check out their [User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) or hit us up with questions

#### Testing
1. Execute the UI unit tests with `npm test`

## API
### API Development
*These instructions assume you're in the `/bartop-api` directory*
#### Install the dependencies
`npm install`

#### Environment Variables

The API is configured using a `.env` file. Use the `.env.example` file as a template to create a local version. Every variable listed in the `.env.example` is _required_ to run the API server.

#### Start the Database
BarTop API uses RethinkDB for its persistence layer. Running the API locally requires a [local of installation of RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/).
Once installed, start a local instance of the database:
`npm run database`

The default database, named `test`, is reserved for running the integration tests. Using this as your development database will have pretty unfortunate consequences, so you will want to create a new one.
To create a new database use the [RethinkDB dashboard](http://localhost:8080/#tables) (while the database is running). Click on `+ Add Database` and enter your desired development database name. Make sure the name of this database matches the BARTOP_DB_NAME variable in your `.env` file.

#### Run the server locally
First, make sure the database is running. Then, start the API server:
`npm start`
The API will be available for requests at http://localhost:3001 (if you set BARTOP_API_PORT to 3001 in your `.env` file).

#### Test the API
The API test suite consists of both unit tests and integration tests.
To run the full test suitem run:
`npm run test-all`

##### Unit tests
These are used to test the controller logic for each endpoint. To run the unit tests, simply run:
`npm test`

##### Integration Tests
These are used to test actual functionality of the API server by making requests and verifying responses with as little mocking as possible. To run the integration tests, run:
`npm run integration-tests`
To run the integration tests, you _must_ be running a local instance of RethinkDB. See [this section](#starting-the-database) for more information.

##### Testing with CI
Travis CI will automatically run all tests (using `npm run test-all`) when a branch is pushed.
